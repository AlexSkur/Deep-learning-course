# Deep learnig course at university

### Lab 1
 Implementation of several activation functions, their derivatives and loss functions with plotting corresponding them graphics.


### Lab 2
Building a Parameter class inspired by Andrej Karpathy's micrograd.\\
Implementation of auto backpropagation by using topological sort.\\
Implementation the activations functions (2 of them) from lab 1.\\
Implementation of gradient descent as a function separate from the class Parameter.
